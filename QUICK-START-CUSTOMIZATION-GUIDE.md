## 🎯 **Step 2: Use Enhanced Context Fields (3 minutes)**

### 📍 **Location:** System Context Panel in UI

I've added 7 new context fields to give AI much better understanding:

#### **🔥 High-Impact Fields:**
- **Business Criticality:** How important is this system?
  - `Critical` = Mission-critical, revenue-impacting
  - `High` = Important user-facing system  
  - `Medium` = Standard business application
  - `Low` = Internal tools, development systems

- **Team Focus:** Who is analyzing this?
  - `Frontend` = UI/UX performance focus
  - `Backend` = API/database optimization focus
  - `DevOps` = Infrastructure and deployment focus
  - `Full Stack` = End-to-end application focus

- **Urgency Level:** How quickly do you need results?
  - `Emergency` = System down, immediate action needed
  - `High` = Performance issue affecting users
  - `Medium` = Regular performance review
  - `Low` = Proactive optimization planning

#### **📊 Context-Rich Fields:**
- **Recent Changes:** "New deployment", "Database migration", "Traffic spike"
- **Performance Goals:** "Reduce latency by 50%", "Handle 10x traffic", "Cut costs by 30%"
- **Known Issues:** "Redis timeouts", "Database slow queries", "Memory leaks"
- **Custom Focus:** "Payment processing bottlenecks", "Mobile performance", "API rate limiting"

## ⚙️ **Step 4: Adjust AI Parameters (2 minutes)**

### 📍 **Location:** `ai-api-server/server.js` Line 265-266

**Current:**
```javascript
max_tokens: 1500,
temperature: 0.3
```

**Customization Options:**

### **🎯 For Focused, Precise Analysis:**
```javascript
max_tokens: 1000,    // Shorter, more concise responses
temperature: 0.1     // Very focused and deterministic
```

### **🎨 For Creative, Comprehensive Analysis:**
```javascript
max_tokens: 2000,    // Longer, more detailed responses  
temperature: 0.5     // More creative and varied suggestions
```

### **⚡ For Emergency Situations:**
```javascript
max_tokens: 800,     // Quick, actionable responses
temperature: 0.1     // Focused on immediate solutions
```

## 📊 **Before vs. After Comparison**

### **🔴 BEFORE (Generic AI):**
```
"Response time has increased by 25%. Consider optimizing database queries 
and implementing caching. Monitor CPU usage and consider scaling resources."
```

### **✅ AFTER (Customized for E-commerce):**
```
"🚨 CRITICAL: 25% response time increase directly impacts conversion rates. 
Based on industry data, every 100ms delay reduces conversions by 1%.

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Revenue Protection):
1. Enable Redis caching for product catalog (Est. impact: 40% latency reduction)
2. Optimize checkout API queries (Critical for conversion funnel)  
3. Implement CDN for product images (Mobile performance priority)

BUSINESS IMPACT: 
- Current delay affects ~$15K daily revenue (assuming 2% conversion baseline)
- Mobile users (60% of traffic) disproportionately affected
- Cart abandonment likely increasing

IMPLEMENTATION EFFORT: Medium (2-4 hours)
EXPECTED RESULTS: 50-60% latency improvement, 0.5% conversion increase"
```
